Hebb's law
The Hebb.py file is an implementation of Hebb's law for AND & OR logical functions
The files in Pattern_Recognition also use Hebb's law to recognize X-like and O-like patterns. In order to test, please do run the GUI.py file, not the other one!
Everything is written from scratch, except for the plots that uses matplotlib library to draw the separator line.
