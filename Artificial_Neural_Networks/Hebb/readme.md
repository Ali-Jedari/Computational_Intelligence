# Hebb's law <br />
The Hebb.py file is an implementation of Hebb's law for AND & OR logical functions <br />
The files in Pattern_Recognition also use Hebb's law to recognize X-like and O-like patterns. In order to test, please do run the GUI.py file, not the other one! <br />
Everything is written from scratch, except for the plots that uses matplotlib library to draw the separator line. <br />
