Perceptron
The Perceptron.py file is an implementation of Perceptron for AND logical function
The files in Pattern_Recognition also use Perceptron to recognize X-like and O-like patterns. In order to test, please do run the GUI.py file, not the other one!
Everything is written from scratch, except for the plots that uses matplotlib library to draw the separator lines.
